One of the\ncomputational bottleneck comes from computing attention over a long sequence of\ninput at each generation step. In this paper, we propose Recycled Attention, an\ninference-time method which alternates between full context attention and\nattention over a subset of input tokens. When performing partial attention, we\nrecycle the attention pattern of a previous token that has performed full\nattention and attend only to the top K most attended tokens, reducing the cost\nof data movement and attention computation. Compared to previously proposed\ninference-time acceleration method which attends only to local context or\ntokens with high accumulative attention scores, our approach flexibly chooses\ntokens that are relevant to the current decoding step. We evaluate our methods\non RULER, a suite of tasks designed to comprehensively evaluate long-context\nabilities, and long-context language modeling tasks. Applying our method to\noff-the-shelf LLMs achieves comparable speedup to baselines which only consider\nlocal context while improving the performance by 2x.

Prior work has proposed a diverse\nset of methods to efficiently learn mixture proportions, ranging from fitting\nregression models over training runs to dynamically updating proportions\nthroughout training.

We find that existing parameterizations of mixing laws can\nexpress the true loss-proportion relationship empirically, but the methods\nthemselves often set the mixing law parameters inaccurately, resulting in poor\nand inconsistent performance. Finally, we leverage the insights from our\nframework to derive a new online method named Aioli, which directly estimates\nthe mixing law parameters throughout training and uses them to dynamically\nadjust proportions. Empirically, Aioli outperforms stratified sampling on 6 out\nof 6 datasets by an average of 0.28 test perplexity points, whereas existing\nmethods fail to consistently beat stratified sampling, doing up to 6.9 points\nworse.

Recently, there has been considerable interest in increasing the\ncontext lengths for these models to enhance their applicability to complex\ntasks. However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value\n(KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new\nbottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen\nAttention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby\nreducing the KV cache memory overhead. Our proposed approach is orthogonal to\nexisting KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with\nthem. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we\ndemonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache\nsizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop\nin performance.

However, as these models grow larger, they require significantly more\nmemory and suffer from higher latency, posing substantial challenges for\ndeployment. In this work, we aim to accelerate diffusion models by quantizing\ntheir weights and activations to 4 bits. At such an aggressive level, both\nweights and activations are highly sensitive, where conventional post-training\nquantization methods for large language models like smoothing become\ninsufficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose SVDQuant, a new 4-bit\nquantization paradigm. Different from smoothing which redistributes outliers\nbetween weights and activations, our approach absorbs these outliers using a\nlow-rank branch. We first consolidate the outliers by shifting them from\nactivations to weights, then employ a high-precision low-rank branch to take in\nthe weight outliers with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This process eases\nthe quantization on both sides. However, na\\\"{\\i}vely running the low-rank\nbranch independently incurs significant overhead due to extra data movement of\nactivations, negating the quantization speedup. To address this, we co-design\nan inference engine Nunchaku that fuses the kernels of the low-rank branch into\nthose of the low-bit branch to cut off redundant memory access.

Although human evaluation\nprovides valuable insights, its cost and time-consuming nature pose\nlimitations. Existing automated metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and CIDEr\nattempt to fill this gap, but they often exhibit weak correlations with human\njudgment. To address this challenge, we propose a novel evaluation framework\ncalled Image2Text2Image, which leverages diffusion models, such as Stable\nDiffusion or DALL-E, for text-to-image generation. In the Image2Text2Image\nframework, an input image is first processed by a selected image captioning\nmodel, chosen for evaluation, to generate a textual description. Using this\ngenerated description, a diffusion model then creates a new image. By comparing\nfeatures extracted from the original and generated images, we measure their\nsimilarity using a designated similarity metric. A high similarity score\nsuggests that the model has produced a faithful textual description, while a\nlow score highlights discrepancies, revealing potential weaknesses in the\nmodel's performance. Notably, our framework does not rely on human-annotated\nreference captions, making it a valuable tool for assessing image captioning\nmodels. Extensive experiments and human evaluations validate the efficacy of\nour proposed Image2Text2Image evaluation framework.

To generate multi-scene videos from the pretrained T2V model, we\nintroduce a simple and effective Time-Aligned Captions (TALC) framework.\nSpecifically, we enhance the text-conditioning mechanism in the T2V\narchitecture to recognize the temporal alignment between the video scenes and\nscene descriptions.

Generally, the forgery quality of\ndifferent deepfakes varies: some have easily recognizable forgery clues, while\nothers are highly realistic. Existing works often train detectors on a mix of\ndeepfakes with varying forgery qualities, potentially leading detectors to\nshort-cut the easy-to-spot artifacts from low-quality forgery samples, thereby\nhurting generalization performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel\nquality-centric framework for generic deepfake detection, which is composed of\na Quality Evaluator, a low-quality data enhancement module, and a learning\npacing strategy that explicitly incorporates forgery quality into the training\nprocess. The framework is inspired by curriculum learning, which is designed to\ngradually enable the detector to learn more challenging deepfake samples,\nstarting with easier samples and progressing to more realistic ones. We employ\nboth static and dynamic assessments to assess the forgery quality, combining\ntheir scores to produce a final rating for each training sample.

To address this, we\nintroduce a large-scale, multi-task video dataset consisting of 1102 sessions\n(each containing videos of finger tapping, facial expression, and speech tasks\ncaptured via webcam) from 845 participants (272 with PD).

UFNet employs independent task-specific\nnetworks, trained with Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty quantification,\nfollowed by self-attended fusion of features, with attention weights\ndynamically adjusted based on task-specific uncertainties. To ensure\npatient-centered evaluation, the participants were randomly split into three\nsets: 60% for training, 20% for model selection, and 20% for final performance\nevaluation. UFNet significantly outperformed single-task models in terms of\naccuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUROC), and sensitivity while maintaining\nnon-inferior specificity.

To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Category\nPath-Enhanced Generative Retrieval(HyPE), which enhances explainability by\ngenerating hierarchical category paths step-by-step before decoding docid. HyPE\nleverages hierarchical category paths as explanation, progressing from broad to\nspecific semantic categories. This approach enables diverse explanations for\nthe same document depending on the query by using shared category paths between\nthe query and the document, and provides reasonable explanation by reflecting\nthe document's semantic structure through a coarse-to-fine manner. HyPE\nconstructs category paths with external high-quality semantic hierarchy,\nleverages LLM to select appropriate candidate paths for each document, and\noptimizes the generative retrieval model with path-augmented dataset. During\ninference, HyPE utilizes path-aware reranking strategy to aggregate diverse\ntopic information, allowing the most relevant documents to be prioritized in\nthe final ranked list of docids.

The core of their\nefficacy is the ability to explicitly exploit the collaborative signals from\nboth the first- and high-order neighboring nodes.

Thus, the noisy information from unreliable\nneighbor nodes (e.g., users with dissimilar interests) negatively impacts the\nrepresentation learning of the target node. Additionally, conducting graph\nconvolution operations without differentiating high-order neighbors suffers the\nover-smoothing issue when stacking more layers, resulting in performance\ndegradation. In this paper, we aim to capture more valuable information from\nhigh-order neighboring nodes while avoiding noise for better representation\nlearning of the target node.

In this work, we aim to accelerate diffusion models by quantizing\ntheir weights and activations to 4 bits. At such an aggressive level, both\nweights and activations are highly sensitive, where conventional post-training\nquantization methods for large language models like smoothing become\ninsufficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose SVDQuant, a new 4-bit\nquantization paradigm.

Furthermore,\nchallenges in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) led to failures in generating precise,\nhuman-intent-aligned code. To tackle these challenges and improve the code\ngeneration performance for automated programming systems, we propose\nFeedback-driven Adaptive Long/short-term memory reinforced Coding Optimization\n(i.e., FALCON). FALCON is structured into two hierarchical levels. From the\nglobal level, long-term memory improves code quality by retaining and applying\nlearned knowledge. At the local level, short-term memory allows for the\nincorporation of immediate feedback from compilers and AI systems.\nAdditionally, we introduce meta-reinforcement learning with feedback rewards to\nsolve the global-local bi-level optimization problem and enhance the model's\nadaptability across diverse code generation tasks.

Effectively managing this\nuncertainty is crucial, but the optimal approach varies depending on the\nspecific details of the task: different tasks require varying levels of\nprecision in different regions of the environment. For instance, a robot\nnavigating a crowded space might need precise localization near obstacles but\ncan operate effectively with less precise state estimates in open areas. This\nvarying need for certainty in different parts of the environment, depending on\nthe task, calls for policies that can adapt their uncertainty management\nstrategies based on task-specific requirements. In this paper, we present a\nframework for integrating task-specific uncertainty requirements directly into\nnavigation policies. We introduce Task-Specific Uncertainty Map (TSUM), which\nrepresents acceptable levels of state estimation uncertainty across different\nregions of the operating environment for a given task. Using TSUM, we propose\nGeneralized Uncertainty Integration for Decision-Making and Execution (GUIDE),\na policy conditioning framework that incorporates these uncertainty\nrequirements into the robot's decision-making process. We find that\nconditioning policies on TSUMs provides an effective way to express\ntask-specific uncertainty requirements and enables the robot to reason about\nthe context-dependent value of certainty.

Intuitively, acquiring more data is a natural and promising\napproach to achieve this goal by reaching a better Pareto frontier of the\nfairness-accuracy tradeoff. The current data acquisition methods, such as fair\nactive learning approaches, typically require annotating sensitive attributes.\nHowever, these sensitive attribute annotations should be protected due to\nprivacy and safety concerns.

The fact that machine learning\nstrongly depends on the learning parameters and the distribution of data across\nfolds recapitulates familiar difficulties around excess false positives and\nreplication. A novel statistical test based on K-fold CV and the Upper Bound of\nthe actual risk (K-fold CUBV) is proposed, where uncertain predictions of\nmachine learning with CV are bounded by the worst case through the evaluation\nof concentration inequalities. Probably Approximately Correct-Bayesian upper\nbounds for linear classifiers in combination with K-fold CV are derived and\nused to estimate the actual risk. The performance with simulated and\nneuroimaging datasets suggests that K-fold CUBV is a robust criterion for\ndetecting effects and validating accuracy values obtained from machine learning\nand classical CV schemes, while avoiding excess false positives.\n","authors":["Juan M Gorriz","R.

To address these problems,\nthe existing solutions typically compress these NeRF representations after the\ntraining stage, leading to a separation between representation training and\ncompression. In this paper, we try to directly learn a compact NeRF\nrepresentation for volumetric video in the training stage based on the proposed\nrate-aware compression framework. Specifically, for volumetric video, we use a\nsimple yet effective modeling strategy to reduce temporal redundancy for the\nNeRF representation. Then, during the training phase, an implicit entropy model\nis utilized to estimate the bitrate of the NeRF representation. This entropy\nmodel is then encoded into the bitstream to assist in the decoding of the NeRF\nrepresentation. This approach enables precise bitrate estimation, thereby\nleading to a compact NeRF representation. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive\nquantization strategy and learn the optimal quantization step for the NeRF\nrepresentations. Finally, the NeRF representation can be optimized by using the\nrate-distortion trade-off. Our proposed compression framework can be used for\ndifferent representations and experimental results demonstrate that our\napproach significantly reduces the storage size with marginal distortion and\nachieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance for volumetric video on\nthe HumanRF and ReRF datasets.

Despite\nrecent progress in this field utilizing deep learning and motion capture data,\nexisting methods are always limited to specific motion categories,\nenvironments, and styles. This poor generalizability can be partially\nattributed to the difficulty and expense of collecting large-scale and\nhigh-quality motion data. At the same time, foundation models trained with\ninternet-scale image and text data have demonstrated surprising world knowledge\nand reasoning ability for various downstream tasks. Utilizing these foundation\nmodels may help with human motion synthesis, which some recent works have\nsuperficially explored. However, these methods didn't fully unveil the\nfoundation models' potential for this task and only support several simple\nactions and environments. In this paper, we for the first time, without any\nmotion data, explore open-set human motion synthesis using natural language\ninstructions as user control signals based on MLLMs across any motion task and\nenvironment. Our framework can be split into two stages: 1) sequential keyframe\ngeneration by utilizing MLLMs as a keyframe designer and animator; 2) motion\nfilling between keyframes through interpolation and motion tracking. Our method\ncan achieve general human motion synthesis for many downstream tasks. The\npromising results demonstrate the worth of mocap-free human motion synthesis\naided by MLLMs and pave the way for future research.\n","authors":["Zhikai Zhang","Yitang Li","Haofeng Huang","Mingxian Lin","Li Yi"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10740v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10733v2","updated":"2024-11-11T17:42:37Z","published":"2024-10-14T17:15:07Z","title":"Deep Compression Autoencoder for Efficient High-Resolution Diffusion\n  Models","summary":"  We present Deep Compression Autoencoder (DC-AE), a new family of autoencoder\nmodels for accelerating high-resolution diffusion models.

Previous approaches either involve intensive fine-tuning of the entire\nT2I model or require users or large language models to specify generation\nlayouts, adding complexity. In this paper, we define semantic binding as the\ntask of associating a given object with its attribute, termed attribute\nbinding, or linking it to other related sub-objects, referred to as object\nbinding. We introduce a novel method called Token Merging (ToMe), which\nenhances semantic binding by aggregating relevant tokens into a single\ncomposite token. This ensures that the object, its attributes and sub-objects\nall share the same cross-attention map. Additionally, to address potential\nconfusion among main objects with complex textual prompts, we propose end token\nsubstitution as a complementary strategy. To further refine our approach in the\ninitial stages of T2I generation, where layouts are determined, we incorporate\ntwo auxiliary losses, an entropy loss and a semantic binding loss, to\niteratively update the composite token to improve the generation integrity. We\nconducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of ToMe,\ncomparing it against various existing methods on the T2I-CompBench and our\nproposed GPT-4o object binding benchmark.

Over\nthe past three decades, advancements in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging\nand machine learning have greatly improved our ability to map visual stimuli to\nbrain activity, especially in the visual cortex. Concurrently, research has\nexpanded into decoding more complex processes like language and memory across\nthe whole brain, utilizing techniques to handle greater variability and improve\nsignal accuracy. We argue that \"seeing\" involves more than just mapping visual\nstimuli onto the visual cortex; it engages the entire brain, as various\nemotions and cognitive states can emerge from observing different scenes. In\nthis paper, we develop algorithms to enhance our understanding of visual\nprocesses by incorporating whole-brain activation maps while individuals are\nexposed to visual stimuli. We utilize large-scale fMRI encoders and Image\ngenerative models pre-trained on large public datasets, which are then\nfine-tuned through Image-fMRI contrastive learning. Our models hence can decode\nvisual experience across the entire cerebral cortex, surpassing the traditional\nconfines of the visual cortex. We first compare our method with\nstate-of-the-art approaches to decoding visual processing and show improved\npredictive semantic accuracy by 43%.

With the growing\ninterest in transformer-based architectures, they are now utilized for gesture\nrecognition. So, we also explore and devise a novel ConvMixFormer architecture\nfor dynamic hand gestures. The transformers use quadratic scaling of the\nattention features with the sequential data, due to which these models are\ncomputationally complex and heavy. We have considered this drawback of the\ntransformer and designed a resource-efficient model that replaces the\nself-attention in the transformer with the simple convolutional layer-based\ntoken mixer. The computational cost and the parameters used for the\nconvolution-based mixer are comparatively less than the quadratic\nself-attention. Convolution-mixer helps the model capture the local spatial\nfeatures that self-attention struggles to capture due to their sequential\nprocessing nature. Further, an efficient gate mechanism is employed instead of\na conventional feed-forward network in the transformer to help the model\ncontrol the flow of features within different stages of the proposed model.\nThis design uses fewer learnable parameters which is nearly half the vanilla\ntransformer that helps in fast and efficient training.

Recent work started mitigating artifacts that break multi-view\ncoherence, including popping artifacts due to inconsistent transparency sorting\nand perspective-correct outlines of (2D) splats. At the same time, real-time\nrequirements forced such implementations to accept compromises in how\ntransparency of large assemblies of 3D Gaussians is resolved, in turn breaking\ncoherence in other ways. In our work, we aim at achieving maximum coherence, by\nrendering fully perspective-correct 3D Gaussians while using a high-quality\napproximation of accurate blending, hybrid transparency, on a per-pixel level,\nin order to retain real-time frame rates. Our fast and perspectively accurate\napproach for evaluation of 3D Gaussians does not require matrix inversions,\nthereby ensuring numerical stability and eliminating the need for special\nhandling of degenerate splats, and the hybrid transparency formulation for\nblending maintains similar quality as fully resolved per-pixel transparencies\nat a fraction of the rendering costs.

Although CLIP performs well, the typical direct latent\nfeature alignment lacks clarity in its representation and similarity scores. On\nthe other hand, lexical representation, a vector whose element represents the\nsimilarity between the sample and a word from the vocabulary, is a natural\nsparse representation and interpretable, providing exact matches for individual\nwords. However, lexical representations are difficult to learn due to no\nground-truth supervision and false-discovery issues, and thus requires complex\ndesign to train effectively. In this paper, we introduce LexVLA, a more\ninterpretable VLA framework by learning a unified lexical representation for\nboth modalities without complex design. We use DINOv2 as our visual model for\nits local-inclined features and Llama 2, a generative language model, to\nleverage its in-context lexical prediction ability. To avoid the false\ndiscovery, we propose an overuse penalty to refrain the lexical representation\nfrom falsely frequently activating meaningless words.

In this paper, we delve into\nthe mechanisms behind the effectiveness of NATs and uncover two important\npatterns that naturally emerge from NATs: Spatially (within a step), although\nmask and visible tokens are processed uniformly by NATs, the interactions\nbetween them are highly asymmetric. In specific, mask tokens mainly gather\ninformation for decoding, while visible tokens tend to primarily provide\ninformation, and their deep representations can be built only upon themselves.\nTemporally (across steps), the interactions between adjacent generation steps\nmostly concentrate on updating the representations of a few critical tokens,\nwhile the computation for the majority of tokens is generally repetitive.\nDriven by these findings, we propose EfficientNAT (ENAT), a NAT model that\nexplicitly encourages these critical interactions inherent in NATs.

However, hand-held\nlow-light photography challenges NeRFs as the captured images may\nsimultaneously suffer from low visibility, noise, and camera shakes. While\nexisting NeRF methods may handle either low light or motion, directly combining\nthem or incorporating additional image-based enhancement methods does not work\nas these degradation factors are highly coupled. We observe that noise in\nlow-light images is always sharp regardless of camera shakes, which implies an\nimplicit order of these degradation factors within the image formation process.\nTo this end, we propose in this paper a novel model, named LuSh-NeRF, which can\nreconstruct a clean and sharp NeRF from a group of hand-held low-light images.\nThe key idea of LuSh-NeRF is to sequentially model noise and blur in the images\nvia multi-view feature consistency and frequency information of NeRF,\nrespectively. Specifically, LuSh-NeRF includes a novel Scene-Noise\nDecomposition (SND) module for decoupling the noise from the scene\nrepresentation and a novel Camera Trajectory Prediction (CTP) module for the\nestimation of camera motions based on low-frequency scene information. To\nfacilitate training and evaluations, we construct a new dataset containing both\nsynthetic and real images. Experiments show that LuSh-NeRF outperforms existing\napproaches.

This limitation is only partially addressed by existing\nknowledge distillation techniques, which often fail to transfer knowledge\neffectively across a broad spectrum of device prototypes with varied\ncapabilities.

To address these challenges, we introduce TAKFL, a novel\nKD-based framework that treats the knowledge transfer from each device\nprototype's ensemble as a separate task, independently distilling each to\npreserve its unique contributions and avoid dilution.

This paper proposes the\nMultimodal Competition Regularizer (MCR), a new loss component inspired by\nmutual information (MI) decomposition designed to prevent the adverse effects\nof competition in multimodal training. Our key contributions are: 1)\nIntroducing game-theoretic principles in multimodal learning, where each\nmodality acts as a player competing to maximize its influence on the final\noutcome, enabling automatic balancing of the MI terms. 2) Refining lower and\nupper bounds for each MI term to enhance the extraction of task-relevant unique\nand shared information across modalities. 3) Suggesting latent space\npermutations for conditional MI estimation, significantly improving\ncomputational efficiency.

In this\nwork, we propose a systematic approach to substantially accelerate the\ncomputation of the tensor products of irreps. We mathematically connect the\ncommonly used Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to the Gaunt coefficients, which are\nintegrals of products of three spherical harmonics. Through Gaunt coefficients,\nthe tensor product of irreps becomes equivalent to the multiplication between\nspherical functions represented by spherical harmonics. This perspective\nfurther allows us to change the basis for the equivariant operations from\nspherical harmonics to a 2D Fourier basis. Consequently, the multiplication\nbetween spherical functions represented by a 2D Fourier basis can be\nefficiently computed via the convolution theorem and Fast Fourier Transforms.\nThis transformation reduces the complexity of full tensor products of irreps\nfrom $\\mathcal{O}(L^6)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(L^3)$, where $L$ is the max degree of\nirreps.

One widely used technique to tackle MOO is\nthrough linear scalarization, where one fixed preference vector is used to\ncombine the objectives into a single scalar value for optimization. However,\nrecent work (Hu et al., 2024) has shown linear scalarization often fails to\ncapture the non-convex regions of the Pareto Front, failing to recover the\ncomplete set of Pareto optimal solutions.

MAN\nTruckScenes allows the research community to come into contact with\ntruck-specific challenges, such as trailer occlusions, novel sensor\nperspectives, and terminal environments for the first time. It comprises more\nthan 740 scenes of 20s each within a multitude of different environmental\nconditions. The sensor set includes 4 cameras, 6 lidar, 6 radar sensors, 2\nIMUs, and a high-precision GNSS. The dataset's 3D bounding boxes were manually\nannotated and carefully reviewed to achieve a high quality standard. Bounding\nboxes are available for 27 object classes, 15 attributes, and a range of more\nthan 230m. The scenes are tagged according to 34 distinct scene tags, and all\nobjects are tracked throughout the scene to promote a wide range of\napplications. Additionally, MAN TruckScenes is the first dataset to provide 4D\nradar data with 360{\\deg} coverage and is thereby the largest radar dataset\nwith annotated 3D bounding boxes.

For example, the use of a PET may cause a delay\nin the responses or adding noise to the data to improve the users' privacy\nmight have a negative impact on the accuracy of the machine learning approach.\nAs of now, there is no structured way how the users' perception of a machine\nlearning based service can contribute to the selection of Privacy Preserving\nMachine Learning (PPML) methods. This is especially a challenge since one\ncannot assume that users have a deep technical understanding of these\ntechnologies.

On\nthe other hand, lexical representation, a vector whose element represents the\nsimilarity between the sample and a word from the vocabulary, is a natural\nsparse representation and interpretable, providing exact matches for individual\nwords. However, lexical representations are difficult to learn due to no\nground-truth supervision and false-discovery issues, and thus requires complex\ndesign to train effectively. In this paper, we introduce LexVLA, a more\ninterpretable VLA framework by learning a unified lexical representation for\nboth modalities without complex design. We use DINOv2 as our visual model for\nits local-inclined features and Llama 2, a generative language model, to\nleverage its in-context lexical prediction ability. To avoid the false\ndiscovery, we propose an overuse penalty to refrain the lexical representation\nfrom falsely frequently activating meaningless words.

We then show on real and simulated data that UMFI performs\nbetter than MCI, especially in the presence of correlated interactions and\nunrelated features, while partially learning the structure of the causal graph\nand reducing the exponential runtime of MCI to super-linear.\n","authors":["Joseph Janssen","Vincent Guan","Elina Robeva"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.09938v5.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06786v1","updated":"2024-11-11T08:25:21Z","published":"2024-11-11T08:25:21Z","title":"ScaleKD: Strong Vision Transformers Could Be Excellent Teachers","summary":"  In this paper, we question if well pre-trained vision transformer (ViT)\nmodels could be used as teachers that exhibit scalable properties to advance\ncross architecture knowledge distillation (KD) research, in the context of\nusing large-scale datasets for evaluation.

This has been\nattributed to modality competition, where modalities strive for training\nresources, leaving some underoptimized.

This raises the question: how can we ensure that all modalities in\nmultimodal training are sufficiently trained, and that learning from new\nmodalities consistently improves performance? This paper proposes the\nMultimodal Competition Regularizer (MCR), a new loss component inspired by\nmutual information (MI) decomposition designed to prevent the adverse effects\nof competition in multimodal training. Our key contributions are: 1)\nIntroducing game-theoretic principles in multimodal learning, where each\nmodality acts as a player competing to maximize its influence on the final\noutcome, enabling automatic balancing of the MI terms. 2) Refining lower and\nupper bounds for each MI term to enhance the extraction of task-relevant unique\nand shared information across modalities. 3) Suggesting latent space\npermutations for conditional MI estimation, significantly improving\ncomputational efficiency.

Given\nthis limitation, there has been a surge of interest in equivariant\nself-supervised learning (E-SSL) that learns features to be augmentation-aware.\nHowever, even for the simplest rotation prediction method, there is a lack of\nrigorous understanding of why, when, and how E-SSL learns useful features for\ndownstream tasks. To bridge this gap between practice and theory, we establish\nan information-theoretic perspective to understand the generalization ability\nof E-SSL. In particular, we identify a critical explaining-away effect in E-SSL\nthat creates a synergy between the equivariant and classification tasks. This\nsynergy effect encourages models to extract class-relevant features to improve\nits equivariant prediction, which, in turn, benefits downstream tasks requiring\nsemantic features.

While recent fully cross-frame self-attention\nmechanisms have improved character consistency across multiple frames, they\ncome with high computational costs and often include redundant operations,\nespecially for videos with higher frame rates. To address these inefficiencies,\nwe propose an adaptive motion-guided cross-frame attention mechanism that\nselectively reduces redundant computations. This enables a greater number of\ncross-frame attentions over more frames within the same computational budget,\nthereby enhancing both video quality and temporal coherence. Our method\nleverages optical flow to focus on moving regions while sparsely attending to\nstationary areas, allowing for the joint editing of more frames without\nincreasing computational demands. Traditional frame interpolation techniques\nstruggle with motion blur and flickering in intermediate frames, which\ncompromises visual fidelity. To mitigate this, we introduce KV-caching for\njointly edited frames, reusing keys and values across intermediate frames to\npreserve visual quality and maintain temporal consistency throughout the video.\nWith our adaptive cross-frame self-attention approach, we achieve a threefold\nincrease in the number of keyframes processed compared to existing methods, all\nwithin the same computational budget as fully cross-frame attention baselines.\nThis results in significant improvements in prediction accuracy and temporal\nconsistency, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

One compares scanned 3D\npoint clouds with design files, assuming these files are always available.\nHowever, such assumptions are often violated in many real-world applications\nwhere model-free products exist, such as fresh produce (i.e., ``Cookie\",\n``Potato\", etc.), dentures, bone, etc. The other category compares patches of\nscanned 3D point clouds with a library of normal patches named memory bank.\nHowever, those methods usually fail to detect incomplete shapes, which is a\nfairly common defect type (i.e., missing pieces of different products). The\nmain challenge is that missing areas in 3D point clouds represent the absence\nof scanned points.

This approach directly\ntranslates the user's textural descriptions into detailed isometric images,\nwhich are then precisely converted into orthographic views, e.g., top, front,\nand side, providing sufficient information to reconstruct 3D CAD models. This\nprocess not only streamlines the creation of CAD models from textual\ndescriptions but also ensures that the resulting models uphold physical and\ndimensional consistency essential for practical engineering applications. Our\nexperimental results show that Text2CAD effectively generates technical\ndrawings that are accurately translated into high-quality 3D CAD models,\nshowing substantial potential to revolutionize CAD automation in response to\nuser demands.\n","authors":["Mohsen Yavartanoo","Sangmin Hong","Reyhaneh Neshatavar","Kyoung Mu Lee"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.06206v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06197v1","updated":"2024-11-09T14:38:08Z","published":"2024-11-09T14:38:08Z","title":"Multi-object Tracking by Detection and Query: an efficient end-to-end\n  manner","summary":"  Multi-object tracking is advancing through two dominant paradigms:\ntraditional tracking by detection and newly emerging tracking by query.

Fusing LiDAR with the weather-robust 4D radar sensor is\nexpected to solve this problem. However, the fusion of LiDAR and 4D radar is\nchallenging because they differ significantly in terms of data quality and the\ndegree of degradation in adverse weather. To address these issues, we introduce\nL4DR, a weather-robust 3D object detection method that effectively achieves\nLiDAR and 4D Radar fusion. Our L4DR includes Multi-Modal Encoding (MME) and\nForeground-Aware Denoising (FAD) technique to reconcile sensor gaps, which is\nthe first exploration of the complementarity of early fusion between LiDAR and\n4D radar. Additionally, we design an Inter-Modal and Intra-Modal ({IM}2 )\nparallel feature extraction backbone coupled with a Multi-Scale Gated Fusion\n(MSGF) module to counteract the varying degrees of sensor degradation under\nadverse weather conditions. Experimental evaluation on a VoD dataset with\nsimulated fog proves that L4DR is more adaptable to changing weather\nconditions.

To\naddress these issues, we first design a multi-modal complementary fusion module\nto extract robust multi-modal semantic features by integrating information from\nvisible and thermal or depth image pairs.

In this work, we propose\nthe principle of interaction asymmetry which states: \"Parts of the same concept\nhave more complex interactions than parts of different concepts\". We formalize\nthis via block diagonality conditions on the $(n+1)$th order derivatives of the\ngenerator mapping concepts to observed data, where different orders of\n\"complexity\" correspond to different $n$. Using this formalism, we prove that\ninteraction asymmetry enables both disentanglement and compositional\ngeneralization.

To be specific, we propose\nthe fine geometry detail encoder (FGDE), which is designed to aggregate fine\ngeometry details in high-resolution low-level image features while\nsimultaneously enriching them with complementary information from\nlow-resolution context-level image features. In addition, we develop the global\ngeometry encoder (GGE) that aims at suppressing noise and extracting global\ngeometric information effectively via constructing compact feature\nrepresentation in a low-rank space. We conduct experiments on multiple\nbenchmark datasets, demonstrating that our GDNet significantly outperforms\ncurrent methods in terms of geometric consistency and detail recovery.

Potato yield can be estimated on a harvester using an\nRGB-D camera that can estimate the three-dimensional (3D) volume of individual\npotato tubers. A challenge, however, is that the 3D shape derived from RGB-D\nimages is only partially completed, underestimating the actual volume. To\naddress this issue, we developed a 3D shape completion network, called CoRe++,\nwhich can complete the 3D shape from RGB-D images. CoRe++ is a deep learning\nnetwork that consists of a convolutional encoder and a decoder. The encoder\ncompresses RGB-D images into latent vectors that are used by the decoder to\ncomplete the 3D shape using the deep signed distance field network (DeepSDF).\nTo evaluate our CoRe++ network, we collected partial and complete 3D point\nclouds of 339 potato tubers on an operational harvester in Japan. On the 1425\nRGB-D images in the test set (representing 51 unique potato tubers), our\nnetwork achieved a completion accuracy of 2.8 mm on average. For volumetric\nestimation, the root mean squared error (RMSE) was 22.6 ml, and this was better\nthan the RMSE of the linear regression (31.1 ml) and the base model (36.9 ml).\nWe found that the RMSE can be further reduced to 18.2 ml when performing the 3D\nshape completion in the center of the RGB-D image. With an average 3D shape\ncompletion time of 10 milliseconds per tuber, we can conclude that CoRe++ is\nboth fast and accurate enough to be implemented on an operational harvester for\nhigh-throughput potato yield estimation. CoRe++'s high-throughput and accurate\nprocessing allows it to be applied to other tuber, fruit and vegetable crops,\nthereby enabling versatile, accurate and real-time yield monitoring in\nprecision agriculture.

In this paper, we propose a novel Fisher information-based\nconditional diffusion (FICD) model to generate high-quality samples according\nto the condition. In particular, we further explore the conditional term from\nthe perspective of Fisher information, where we show Fisher information can act\nas a weight to measure the informativeness of the condition in each generation\nstep. According to this new perspective, we can control and gain more\ninformation along the conditional direction in the generation space. Thus, we\npropose the upper bound of the Fisher information to reformulate the\nconditional term, which increases the information gain and decreases the time\ncost. Experimental results also demonstrate that the proposed FICD can offer up\nto 2x speed-ups under the same sampling steps as most baselines.

In image editing, DiTs project text and image\ninputs to a joint latent space, from which they decode and synthesize new\nimages. However, it remains largely unexplored how multimodal information\ncollectively forms this joint space and how they guide the semantics of the\nsynthesized images. In this paper, we investigate the latent space of DiT\nmodels and uncover two key properties: First, DiT's latent space is inherently\nsemantically disentangled, where different semantic attributes can be\ncontrolled by specific editing directions. Second, consistent semantic editing\nrequires utilizing the entire joint latent space, as neither encoded image nor\ntext alone contains enough semantic information. We show that these editing\ndirections can be obtained directly from text prompts, enabling precise\nsemantic control without additional training or mask annotations. Based on\nthese insights, we propose a simple yet effective Encode-Identify-Manipulate\n(EIM) framework for zero-shot fine-grained image editing. Specifically, we\nfirst encode both the given source image and the text prompt that describes the\nimage, to obtain the joint latent embedding. Then, using our proposed Hessian\nScore Distillation Sampling (HSDS) method, we identify editing directions that\ncontrol specific target attributes while preserving other image features. These\ndirections are guided by text prompts and used to manipulate the latent\nembeddings. Moreover, we propose a new metric to quantify the disentanglement\ndegree of the latent space of diffusion models. Extensive experiment results on\nour new curated benchmark dataset and analysis demonstrate DiT's\ndisentanglement properties and effectiveness of the EIM framework.\n","authors":["Zitao Shuai","Chenwei Wu","Zhengxu Tang","Bowen Song","Liyue Shen"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.08196v1.pdf","comment":"arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2408.13335"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08195v1","updated":"2024-11-12T21:33:11Z","published":"2024-11-12T21:33:11Z","title":"An Explainable Machine Learning Approach for Age and Gender Estimation\n  in Living Individuals Using Dental Biometrics","summary":"  Objectives: Age and gender estimation is crucial for various applications,\nincluding forensic investigations and anthropological studies.

This question has attracted considerable attention, with most studies\nanalyzing the extent to which the language skills of LLMs resemble rules. As of\nyet, it is not known whether linguistic generalization in LLMs could equally\nwell be explained as the result of analogical processes, which can be\nformalized as similarity operations on stored exemplars. A key shortcoming of\nprior research is its focus on linguistic phenomena with a high degree of\nregularity, for which rule-based and analogical approaches make the same\npredictions. Here, we instead examine derivational morphology, specifically\nEnglish adjective nominalization, which displays notable variability. We\nintroduce a new method for investigating linguistic generalization in LLMs:\nfocusing on GPT-J, we fit cognitive models that instantiate rule-based and\nanalogical learning to the LLM training data and compare their predictions on a\nset of nonce adjectives with those of the LLM, allowing us to draw direct\nconclusions regarding underlying mechanisms. As expected, rule-based and\nanalogical models explain the predictions of GPT-J equally well for adjectives\nwith regular nominalization patterns. However, for adjectives with variable\nnominalization patterns, the analogical model provides a much better match.\nFurthermore, GPT-J's behavior is sensitive to the individual word frequencies,\neven for regular forms, a behavior that is consistent with an analogical\naccount of regular forms but not a rule-based one. These findings refute the\nhypothesis that GPT-J's linguistic generalization on adjective nominalization\ninvolves rules, suggesting similarity operations on stored exemplars as the\nunderlying mechanism. Overall, our study suggests that analogical processes\nplay a bigger role in the linguistic generalization of LLMs than previously\nthought.\n","authors":["Valentin Hofmann","Leonie Weissweiler","David Mortensen","Hinrich Sch√ºtze","Janet Pierrehumbert"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07990v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02271v2","updated":"2024-11-12T18:11:30Z","published":"2024-11-04T17:03:52Z","title":"On the Utilization of Unique Node Identifiers in Graph Neural Networks","summary":"  Graph Neural Networks have inherent representational limitations due to their\nmessage-passing structure.

It is often unclear whether the observed generalization behaviour\narises specifically from the second-order nature of the parameter updates, or\ninstead reflects the specific structured (e.g.\\ Kronecker) approximations used\nor any damping-based interpolation towards first-order updates.

In such an approach, the validity relies heavily on the consistency\nof nonparametric estimators and is limited by the nonparametric convergence\nrate, thereby preventing $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency. To address these issues, we\npropose the DR-RD estimator, which combines two distinct estimators for the\nconditional expected outcomes.

Nevertheless, we show that mild\ngeneralization beyond the dataset can be trusted and leveraged to improve\nperformance under certain conditions.

This vision requires the seamless integration of three fundamental\nmodules: Sensing for information acquisition, communication for information\nsharing, and computation for information processing and decision-making. These\nmodules are intricately linked, especially in complex tasks such as edge\nlearning and inference. However, the performance of these modules is\ninterdependent, creating a resource competition for time, energy, and\nbandwidth. Existing techniques like integrated communication and computation\n(ICC), integrated sensing and computation (ISC), and integrated sensing and\ncommunication (ISAC) have made partial strides in addressing this challenge,\nbut they fall short of meeting the extreme performance requirements. To\novercome these limitations, it is essential to develop new techniques that\ncomprehensively integrate sensing, communication, and computation. This\nintegrated approach, known as Integrated Sensing, Communication, and\nComputation (ISCC), offers a systematic perspective for enhancing task\nperformance. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of historic and\nrelated techniques such as ICC, ISC, and ISAC, highlighting their strengths and\nlimitations. It then discusses the benefits, functions, and challenges of ISCC.\nSubsequently, the state-of-the-art signal designs for ISCC, along with network\nresource management strategies specifically tailored for ISCC are explored.\nFurthermore, this paper discusses the exciting research opportunities that lie\nahead for implementing ISCC in future advanced networks, and the unresolved\nissues requiring further investigation.

We prove that particular\narchitectural topologies decrease the local entropy of feature maps, which\ndegrades specific features to a bias, thereby reducing network performance.\nBased on this proof, architectural topologies are utilized to quantify the\nsuppression of local entropy decrease (SED) as a data-free and running-free\nproxy. Experimental results show that SED outperforms most state-of-the-art\nproxies in terms of architecture selection on five benchmarks, with computation\ntime reduced by three orders of magnitude. We further compare the SED-based NAS\nwith state-of-the-art proxies. SED-based NAS selects the architecture with\nhigher accuracy and fewer parameters in only one second. The theoretical\nanalyses of local entropy and experimental results demonstrate that the\nsuppression of local entropy decrease facilitates selecting optimal\narchitectures in Zero-Shot NAS.\n","authors":["Ning Wu","Han Huang","Yueting Xu","Zhifeng Hao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.06236v2.pdf","comment":"8 pages, 2 figures.

Broadly, the goal is to estimate differences in event rates under\ntwo treatments within a defined target population over a specified followup\nwindow. Estimation with observational data is challenging because, while\nmembership in the target population is defined in terms of eligibility\ncriteria, treatment is rarely observed exactly at the time of eligibility.\nAd-hoc solutions to this timing misalignment can induce bias by incorrectly\nattributing prior event counts and person-time to treatment. Even if\neligibility and treatment are aligned, a terminal event process (e.g. death)\noften stops the recurrent event process of interest. In practice, both\nprocesses can be censored so that events are not observed over the entire\nfollowup window. Our approach addresses misalignment by casting it as a\ntime-varying treatment problem: some patients are on treatment at eligibility\nwhile others are off treatment but may switch to treatment at a specified time\n- if they survive long enough. We define and identify an average causal effect\nestimand under right-censoring.

PMI, however, is not always available, and its\nprecise estimation remains one of the core challenges in forensic examination.\nThis paper presents the first known to us method of the PMI estimation directly\nfrom iris images captured after death. To assess the feasibility of the\niris-based PMI estimation, we designed models predicting the PMI from (a)\nnear-infrared (NIR), (b) visible (RGB), and (c) multispectral (RGB+NIR)\nforensic iris images. Models were evaluated following a 10-fold\ncross-validation, in (S1) sample-disjoint, (S2) subject-disjoint, and (S3)\ncross-dataset scenarios. We explore two data balancing techniques for S3:\nresampling-based balancing (S3-real), and synthetic data-supplemented balancing\n(S3-synthetic). We found that using the multispectral data offers a\nspectacularly low mean absolute error (MAE) of $\\approx 3.5$ hours in the\nscenario (S1), a bit worse MAE $\\approx 17.5$ hours in the scenario (S2), and\nMAE $\\approx 45.77$ hours in the scenario (S3). Additionally, supplementing the\ntraining set with synthetically-generated forensic iris images (S3-synthetic)\nsignificantly enhances the models' ability to generalize to new NIR, RGB and\nmultispectral data collected in a different lab. This suggests that if the\nenvironmental conditions are favorable (\\eg, bodies are kept in low\ntemperatures), forensic iris images provide features that are indicative of the\nPMI and can be automatically estimated.\n","authors":["Rasel Ahmed Bhuiyan","Adam Czajka"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10172v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13880v4","updated":"2024-11-13T18:31:18Z","published":"2024-04-22T05:07:02Z","title":"Regional Style and Color Transfer","summary":"  This paper presents a novel contribution to the field of regional style\ntransfer.

OSMLoc is a brain-inspired single-image visual localization method\nwith semantic and geometric guidance to improve accuracy, robustness, and\ngeneralization ability. First, we equip the OSMLoc with the visual foundational\nmodel to extract powerful image features.

While BEDLAM\ndemonstrates the potential of traditional procedural graphics to generate such\ndata, the training images are clearly synthetic. In contrast, generative image\nmodels produce highly realistic images but without ground truth. Putting these\nmethods together seems straightforward: use a generative model with the body\nground truth as controlling signal. However, we find that, the more realistic\nthe generated images, the more they deviate from the ground truth, making them\ninappropriate for training and evaluation. Enhancements of realistic details,\nsuch as clothing and facial expressions, can lead to subtle yet significant\ndeviations from the ground truth, potentially misleading training models. We\nempirically verify that this misalignment causes the accuracy of HPS networks\nto decline when trained with generated images. To address this, we design a\ncontrollable synthesis method that effectively balances image realism with\nprecise ground truth. We use this to create the Generative BEDLAM (Gen-B)\ndataset, which improves the realism of the existing synthetic BEDLAM dataset\nwhile preserving ground truth accuracy. We perform extensive experiments, with\nvarious noise-conditioning strategies, to evaluate the tradeoff between visual\nrealism and HPS accuracy.

However, most of them were\nblack-box systems which faced challenges regarding explainability during\ntraining and inference processes. An important question is how to incorporate\nexplicit knowledge into these implicit models, thereby designing expert-driven\nand interpretable violence surveillance systems. This paper proposes a new\nparadigm for weakly supervised violence monitoring (WSVM) called Rule base\nViolence Monitoring (RuleVM). The proposed RuleVM uses a dual-branch structure\nwith different designs for images and text. One of the branches is called the\nimplicit branch, which uses only visual features for coarse-grained binary\nclassification. In this branch, image feature extraction is divided into two\nchannels: one responsible for extracting scene frames and the other focusing on\nextracting actions. The other branch is called the explicit branch, which\nutilizes language-image alignment to perform fine-grained classification. For\nthe language channel design in the explicit branch, the proposed RuleCLIP uses\nthe state-of-the-art YOLO-World model to detect objects in video frames, and\nassociation rules are identified through data mining methods as descriptions of\nthe video. Leveraging the dual-branch architecture, RuleVM achieves\ninterpretable coarse-grained and fine-grained violence surveillance.

Moreover, applying latent diffusion models on real data often yields\na textural shift incoherent to the image condition due to auto-encoding errors.\nThese two problems are further reinforced with the use of pixel-distance\nlosses.

In contrast, we adopt methods from mechanistic\ninterpretability to study the higher-level visual algorithms that ViTs use to\nperform abstract visual reasoning.

However, since they\nare typically trained on clean data, they remain vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks. Despite this vulnerability, their superior performance and\ntransferability make off-the-shelf classifiers still valuable in practice,\ndemanding further work to provide adversarial robustness for them in a post-hoc\nmanner. A recently proposed method, denoised smoothing, leverages a denoiser\nmodel in front of the classifier to obtain provable robustness without\nadditional training. However, the denoiser often creates hallucination, i.e.,\nimages that have lost the semantics of their originally assigned class, leading\nto a drop in robustness. Furthermore, its noise-and-denoise procedure\nintroduces a significant distribution shift from the original distribution,\ncausing the denoised smoothing framework to achieve sub-optimal robustness. In\nthis paper, we introduce Fine-Tuning with Confidence-Aware Denoised Image\nSelection (FT-CADIS), a novel fine-tuning scheme to enhance the certified\nrobustness of off-the-shelf classifiers. FT-CADIS is inspired by the\nobservation that the confidence of off-the-shelf classifiers can effectively\nidentify hallucinated images during denoised smoothing. Based on this, we\ndevelop a confidence-aware training objective to handle such hallucinated\nimages and improve the stability of fine-tuning from denoised images. In this\nway, the classifier can be fine-tuned using only images that are beneficial for\nadversarial robustness. We also find that such a fine-tuning can be done by\nupdating a small fraction of parameters of the classifier. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that FT-CADIS has established the state-of-the-art\ncertified robustness among denoised smoothing methods across all\n$\\ell_2$-adversary radius in various benchmarks.\n","authors":["Suhyeok Jang","Seojin Kim","Jinwoo Shin","Jongheon Jeong"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.08933v1.pdf","comment":"26 pages; TMLR 2024; Code is available at\n  https://github.com/suhyeok24/FT-CADIS"}],"Machine Learning":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08878v1","updated":"2024-11-13T18:55:10Z","published":"2024-11-13T18:55:10Z","title":"A Short Note on Evaluating RepNet for Temporal Repetition Counting in\n  Videos","summary":"  We discuss some consistent issues on how RepNet has been evaluated in various\npapers.

Often, rather than just understanding the effects of\ncauses, researchers also wish to understand how a cause $X$ affects an outcome\n$Y$ mechanistically -- i.e., what are the causal pathways that are activated\nbetween $X$ and $Y$. For analyzing such questions, a range of methods has been\ndeveloped over decades under the rubric of causal mediation analysis.\nTraditional mediation analysis focuses on decomposing the average treatment\neffect (ATE) into direct and indirect effects, and therefore focuses on the ATE\nas the central quantity. This corresponds to providing explanations for\nassociations in the interventional regime, such as when the treatment $X$ is\nrandomized. Commonly, however, it is of interest to explain associations in the\nobservational regime, and not just in the interventional regime. In this paper,\nwe introduce \\text{variation analysis}, an extension of mediation analysis that\nfocuses on the total variation (TV) measure between $X$ and $Y$, written as\n$\\mathrm{E}[Y \\mid X=x_1] - \\mathrm{E}[Y \\mid X=x_0]$. The TV measure\nencompasses both causal and confounded effects, as opposed to the ATE which\nonly encompasses causal (direct and mediated) variations. In this way, the TV\nmeasure is suitable for providing explanations in the natural regime and\nanswering questions such as ``why is $X$ associated with $Y$?''. Our focus is\non decomposing the TV measure, in a way that explicitly includes direct,\nindirect, and confounded variations. Furthermore, we also decompose the TV\nmeasure to include interaction terms between these different pathways.\nSubsequently, interaction testing is introduced, involving hypothesis tests to\ndetermine if interaction terms are significantly different from zero. If\ninteractions are not significant, more parsimonious decompositions of the TV\nmeasure can be used.\n","authors":["Drago Plecko"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.08861v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13880v4","updated":"2024-11-13T18:31:18Z","published":"2024-04-22T05:07:02Z","title":"Regional Style and Color Transfer","summary":"  This paper presents a novel contribution to the field of regional style\ntransfer.

This paper reformulates the parameter\nestimation problem of differential equations as an optimization problem by\nintroducing the concept of particles from the particle swarm optimization\nalgorithm. Building on reinforcement learning-based particle swarm optimization\n(RLLPSO), this paper proposes a novel method, DERLPSO, for estimating unknown\nparameters of differential equations.

SAD-TIME incorporates an automated nodes' common\nfeatures extractor (CFE), a spatial sector (SpS), a modified temporal sector\n(TeS), and a domain adversarial learner (DAL). The CFE includes a multi-scale\ndepth-wise 1D-convolutional neural network and a time-interval embedding\ngenerator, where the unique information of each channel is preserved. The SpS\nfuses the functional connectivity with the distance-based connectivity\ncontaining spatial position of EEG electrodes.

However, the\ngeneralization properties of second-order methods are still being debated.\nTheoretical investigations have proved difficult to carry out outside the\ntractable settings of heavily simplified model classes -- thus, the relevance\nof existing theories to practical deep learning applications remains unclear.\nSimilarly, empirical studies in large-scale models and real datasets are\nsignificantly confounded by the necessity to approximate second-order updates\nin practice. It is often unclear whether the observed generalization behaviour\narises specifically from the second-order nature of the parameter updates, or\ninstead reflects the specific structured (e.g.\\ Kronecker) approximations used\nor any damping-based interpolation towards first-order updates. Here, we show\nfor the first time that exact Gauss-Newton (GN) updates take on a tractable\nform in a class of deep reversible architectures that are sufficiently\nexpressive to be meaningfully applied to common benchmark datasets. We exploit\nthis novel setting to study the training and generalization properties of the\nGN optimizer. We find that exact GN generalizes poorly. In the mini-batch\ntraining setting, this manifests as rapidly saturating progress even on the\n\\emph{training} loss, with parameter updates found to overfit each\nmini-batchatch without producing the features that would support generalization\nto other mini-batches. We show that our experiments run in the ``lazy'' regime,\nin which the neural tangent kernel (NTK) changes very little during the course\nof training. This behaviour is associated with having no significant changes in\nneural representations, explaining the lack of generalization.\n","authors":["Davide Buffelli","Jamie McGowan","Wangkun Xu","Alexandru Cioba","Da-shan Shiu","Guillaume Hennequin","Alberto Bernacchia"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07979v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted at NeurIPS 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17804v3","updated":"2024-11-13T09:50:48Z","published":"2024-06-22T15:24:33Z","title":"A Review of Electromagnetic Elimination Methods for low-field portable\n  MRI scanner","summary":"  This paper analyzes conventional and deep learning methods for eliminating\nelectromagnetic interference (EMI) in MRI systems.

Significant efforts have been devoted to\nmitigating such generalization, and recent in-sample learning approaches have\nfurther succeeded in entirely eschewing it. Nevertheless, we show that mild\ngeneralization beyond the dataset can be trusted and leveraged to improve\nperformance under certain conditions. To appropriately exploit generalization\nin offline RL, we propose Doubly Mild Generalization (DMG), comprising (i) mild\naction generalization and (ii) mild generalization propagation. The former\nrefers to selecting actions in a close neighborhood of the dataset to maximize\nthe Q values. Even so, the potential erroneous generalization can still be\npropagated, accumulated, and exacerbated by bootstrapping. In light of this,\nthe latter concept is introduced to mitigate the generalization propagation\nwithout impeding the propagation of RL learning signals. Theoretically, DMG\nguarantees better performance than the in-sample optimal policy in the oracle\ngeneralization scenario. Even under worst-case generalization, DMG can still\ncontrol value overestimation at a certain level and lower bound the\nperformance.

This is accomplished through several novel\nadvances, in particular, simultaneous sample conditioned flows over the main\nand conditioning variables, alongside a conditional Wasserstein distance and\nkernel facilitating conditional optimal transport. Collectively, these advances\nallow for learning system dynamics provided measurement data whose states and\nconditioning variables are not in correspondence. We demonstrate CVFM on a\nsuite of increasingly challenging problems, including discrete and continuous\nconditional mapping benchmarks, image-to-image domain transfer, and modeling\nthe temporal evolution of materials internal structure during manufacturing\nprocesses. We observe that CVFM results in improved performance and convergence\ncharacteristics over alternative conditional variants.\n","authors":["Adam P. Generale","Andreas E. Robertson","Surya R.

This has\nshifted the memory footprint of LLMs during training disproportionately to one\nsingle layer: the cross-entropy in the loss computation. Cross-entropy builds\nup a logit matrix with entries for each pair of input tokens and vocabulary\nitems and, for small models, consumes an order of magnitude more memory than\nthe rest of the LLM combined. We propose Cut Cross-Entropy (CCE), a method that\ncomputes the cross-entropy loss without materializing the logits for all tokens\ninto global memory. Rather, CCE only computes the logit for the correct token\nand evaluates the log-sum-exp over all logits on the fly. We implement a custom\nkernel that performs the matrix multiplications and the log-sum-exp reduction\nover the vocabulary in flash memory, making global memory consumption for the\ncross-entropy computation negligible. This has a dramatic effect. Taking the\nGemma 2 (2B) model as an example, CCE reduces the memory footprint of the loss\ncomputation from 24 GB to 1 MB, and the total training-time memory consumption\nof the classifier head from 28 GB to 1 GB. To improve the throughput of CCE, we\nleverage the inherent sparsity of softmax and propose to skip elements of the\ngradient computation that have a negligible (i.e., below numerical precision)\ncontribution to the gradient.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a new family of compact vision-language-action models, called\nTinyVLA, which offers two key advantages over existing VLA models: (1) faster\ninference speeds, and (2) improved data efficiency, eliminating the need for\npre-training stage. Our framework incorporates two essential components to\nbuild TinyVLA: (1) initializing the policy backbone with robust, high-speed\nmultimodal models, and (2) integrating a diffusion policy decoder during\nfine-tuning to enable precise robot actions. We conducted extensive evaluations\nof TinyVLA in both simulation and on real robots, demonstrating that our\napproach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model, OpenVLA, in\nterms of speed and data efficiency, while delivering comparable or superior\nperformance.

Recently, vision-language models such as CLIP\nprovide significant advances in both two issues, but constructing precise\ncategory descriptions is still in its infancy due to the absence of unseen\ncategories. This work introduces two hierarchical contexts, namely perceptual\ncontext and spurious context, to carefully describe the precise category\nboundary through automatic prompt tuning. Specifically, perceptual contexts\nperceive the inter-category difference (e.g., cats vs apples) for current\nclassification tasks, while spurious contexts further identify spurious\n(similar but exactly not) OOD samples for every single category (e.g., cats vs\npanthers, apples vs peaches). The two contexts hierarchically construct the\nprecise description for a certain category, which is, first roughly classifying\na sample to the predicted category and then delicately identifying whether it\nis truly an ID sample or actually OOD. Moreover, the precise descriptions for\nthose categories within the vision-language framework present a novel\napplication: CATegory-EXtensible OOD detection (CATEX). One can efficiently\nextend the set of recognizable categories by simply merging the hierarchical\ncontexts learned under different sub-task settings.

Consequently, DEM has become a widely accepted\napproach for tackling engineering problems connected to granular flows and\npowder mechanics. Additionally, DEM can be integrated with grid-based\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, enabling the simulation of chemical\nprocesses taking place, e.g., in fluidized beds.

This justifies the success of data-based\ninitialization for score matching methods despite slow mixing for the data\ndistribution, and improves and generalizes the results of Koehler and Vuong\n(2023) to have linear, rather than exponential, dependence on $k$ and apply to\narbitrary semigroups. As a consequence of our results, we show for the first\ntime that a natural class of low-complexity Ising measures can be efficiently\nlearned from samples.\n","authors":["Frederic Koehler","Holden Lee","Thuy-Duong Vuong"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.09117v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13306v4","updated":"2024-11-14T01:18:01Z","published":"2023-01-30T21:59:30Z","title":"Autobidders with Budget and ROI Constraints: Efficiency, Regret, and\n  Pacing Dynamics","summary":"  We study a game between autobidding algorithms that compete in an online\nadvertising platform.

While generative models have shown great promise in\ncapturing the intricate dynamics inherent in time series, evaluating their\nperformance remains a major challenge. Traditional evaluation metrics fall\nshort due to the temporal dependencies and potential high dimensionality of the\nfeatures. In this paper, we propose the REcurrent NeurAL (RENAL)\nGoodness-of-Fit test, a novel and statistically rigorous framework for\nevaluating generative time series models. By leveraging recurrent neural\nnetworks, we transform the time series into conditionally independent data\npairs, enabling the application of a chi-square-based goodness-of-fit test to\nthe temporal dependencies within the data. This approach offers a robust,\ntheoretically grounded solution for assessing the quality of generative models,\nparticularly in settings with limited time sequences. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of our method across both synthetic and real-world datasets,\noutperforming existing methods in terms of reliability and accuracy.

Among the different numerical methods\navailable, the discrete element method (DEM) provides one of the most accurate\nrepresentations of a wide range of physical systems involving granular and\ndiscontinuous materials. Consequently, DEM has become a widely accepted\napproach for tackling engineering problems connected to granular flows and\npowder mechanics. Additionally, DEM can be integrated with grid-based\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, enabling the simulation of chemical\nprocesses taking place, e.g., in fluidized beds. However, DEM is\ncomputationally intensive because of the intrinsic multiscale nature of\nparticulate systems, restricting simulation duration or number of particles.\nTowards this end, NeuralDEM presents an end-to-end approach to replace slow\nnumerical DEM routines with fast, adaptable deep learning surrogates. NeuralDEM\nis capable of picturing long-term transport processes across different regimes\nusing macroscopic observables without any reference to microscopic model\nparameters. First, NeuralDEM treats the Lagrangian discretization of DEM as an\nunderlying continuous field, while simultaneously modeling macroscopic behavior\ndirectly as additional auxiliary fields. Second, NeuralDEM introduces\nmulti-branch neural operators scalable to real-time modeling of\nindustrially-sized scenarios - from slow and pseudo-steady to fast and\ntransient. Such scenarios have previously posed insurmountable challenges for\ndeep learning models. Notably, NeuralDEM faithfully models coupled CFD-DEM\nfluidized bed reactors of 160k CFD cells and 500k DEM particles for\ntrajectories of 28s. NeuralDEM will open many new doors to advanced engineering\nand much faster process cycles.\n","authors":["Benedikt Alkin","Tobias Kronlachner","Samuele Papa","Stefan Pirker","Thomas Lichtenegger","Johannes Brandstetter"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.09678v1.pdf","comment":"Project page: https://nx-ai.github.io/NeuralDEM/"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09267v1","updated":"2024-11-14T08:08:25Z","published":"2024-11-14T08:08:25Z","title":"Towards efficient compression and communication for prototype-based\n  decentralized learning","summary":"  In prototype-based federated learning, the exchange of model parameters\nbetween clients and the master server is replaced by transmission of prototypes\nor quantized versions of the data samples to the aggregation server. A fully\ndecentralized deployment of prototype-based learning, without a central\nagregartor of prototypes, is more robust upon network failures and reacts\nfaster to changes in the statistical distribution of the data, suggesting\npotential advantages and quick adaptation in dynamic learning tasks, e.g., when\nthe data sources are IoT devices or when data is non-iid. In this paper, we\nconsider the problem of designing a communication-efficient decentralized\nlearning system based on prototypes. We address the challenge of prototype\nredundancy by leveraging on a twofold data compression technique, i.e., sending\nonly update messages if the prototypes are informationtheoretically useful (via\nthe Jensen-Shannon distance), and using clustering on the prototypes to\ncompress the update messages used in the gossip protocol. We also use parallel\ninstead of sequential gossiping, and present an analysis of its\nage-of-information (AoI).

Dual Temporal Grounding for Video Dialog","summary":"  In the realm of video dialog response generation, the understanding of video\ncontent and the temporal nuances of conversation history are paramount. While a\nsegment of current research leans heavily on large-scale pretrained\nvisual-language models and often overlooks temporal dynamics, another delves\ndeep into spatial-temporal relationships within videos but demands intricate\nobject trajectory pre-extractions and sidelines dialog temporal dynamics. This\npaper introduces the Dual Temporal Grounding-enhanced Video Dialog model\n(DTGVD), strategically designed to merge the strengths of both dominant\napproaches. It emphasizes dual temporal relationships by predicting dialog\nturn-specific temporal regions, filtering video content accordingly, and\ngrounding responses in both video and dialog contexts. One standout feature of\nDTGVD is its heightened attention to chronological interplay. By recognizing\nand acting upon the dependencies between different dialog turns, it captures\nmore nuanced conversational dynamics. To further bolster the alignment between\nvideo and dialog temporal dynamics, we've implemented a list-wise contrastive\nlearning strategy. Within this framework, accurately grounded turn-clip\npairings are designated as positive samples, while less precise pairings are\ncategorized as negative.
